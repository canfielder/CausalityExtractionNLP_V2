__label__0 the article suggests how the hrm systems influences the economic performances of the firm ,  and the „waterfall performance approach” could be a useful pathway for scholars pursuing this line of research . 
__label__0 it is this commitment to the environment that we believe defines the strength of organizations’ em efforts and its ultimate influence on corporate behavior . 
__label__0 in addition ,  the long-chain mediation tests revealed that a unit’s hpws was indirectly and positively related to the unit’s market performance ﬁrst via establishing favorable dual climates of concern for employees and concern for customers ,  and then via motivating employee service performance and helping behavior . 
__label__0 in addition to its direct contribution to the stakeholder management and corporate social responsibility literature ,  this study also contributes to the rbv . 
__label__0 in addition ,  strong ﬁndings could have practical implications for managers seeking to improve new venture performance through assembling appropriate entrepreneurial teams . 
__label__0 csr reporting substantiveness is an overall rating of csr activities as portrayed in the report . 
__label__0 very low quit rates can result in workforce skill stagnation ,  closed-mindedness ,  and “trained incapacity” that in the aggregate reduce organizational productivity and increase accidents . 
__label__0 managers can establish the mechanisms that encourage the involvement of the ﬁrm’s manufacturing activities within tc by using specialized and cross-functional task forces that combine and coordinate the use of different manufacturing sources . 
__label__0 as a consequence ,  they now span the full spectrum of jobs from highly labor-intensive code migration work such as the integration of old mainframe-based systems into new e-commerce platforms ,  or developing new code for pre-designed applications and software tools ,  to projects that involve both conceptual design and implementation of customer relationship applications and supply-chain management systems . 
__label__0 in sum ,  we predict that ,  among restaurant chains ,  strategic resources and performance will be positively related . 
__label__0 thus combining different aspects of csr activities cannot capture variations in firm performance that can be explained by the multi-dimensional approach . 
__label__0 this can best be understood by identifying distinct ,  internally consistent sets of hr practices and their relationships to organization’s business strategy and performance outcomes . 
__label__0 these data were obtained from the uk labour force survey ,  which is based on samples of individuals 16 to 65 years of age in 63 u . k .  counties . 
__label__0 use of clean technologies also adds complexity to production or delivery processes and requires increased skills from workers at all levels of the firm  . 
__label__0 to this end ,  these procedures produced a sample of 611 ﬁrms . 
__label__0 this result is consistent with the discretionary disclosure theories of verrecchia and dye  ,  but inconsistent with the negative association predicted by socio-political theories . 
__label__0  . 
__label__0 defender banks would most likely not be able to match the variety of opportunities ,  given their focus on stable markets ,  and consequently they would focus on other aspects for recruitment . 
__label__0 thus ,  taking this into account ,  we believe the variance explained in our study is similar to other studies . 
__label__0 second ,  we correlated a statement in the 1999 survey with the ﬁgures that managers reported about the speed of their new product introductions . 
__label__0 the best of both worlds ? 
__label__0 building upon the resource-based view of the ﬁrm ,  some recent work regards a ﬁrm’s good relations with its stakeholders as valuable ,  rare ,  inimitable ,  and non-substitutable resources that contribute to the ﬁrm’s gaining and sustaining a performance advantage  . 
__label__0 overall ,  therefore ,  aggrega-tion to the bdg level seems justified on both substantive and statistical grounds and ,  accordingly ,  bdg climate scores were calculated by aver-aging individual climate scores within each bdg . 
__label__0 and if researchers limit cases to only those firms that will allow application of the most rigorous methodological standards ,  the sample of firms considered may be skewed and quite unrepresentative of the general population . 
__label__0 dalton ,  d .  r .  ,  & kesner ,  i .  f .  1985 . 
__label__0 the results are consistent with those in table a1: ﬁrms that “default to local environmental standards” pollute statistically signiﬁcantly more than ﬁrms that apply “an internal global standard;” ﬁrms that “default to local environmental standards” pollute more than ﬁrms that apply “u . s . 
__label__0 the four cluster groupings identified in table 1 were entered as the independent variables; the three firm performance measures were entered as the dependent variables; and all of the control variables were entered as covariates .

__label__0 recently ,  others ,  such as selmer and de leon and skene  ,  have supported the earlier ﬁndings by amante by providing additional empirical evidence supporting the evolution of personnel management to hrm in the philippines .
